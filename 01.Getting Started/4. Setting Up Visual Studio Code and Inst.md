# Setting Up Visual Studio Code and Installing HashiCorp Terraform Extension

Follow these steps to set up Visual Studio Code and install the HashiCorp Terraform extension for working with Terraform configurations.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Download and Install Visual Studio Code

1. Go to the [Visual Studio Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2. Download the installer for Windows.
3. Double-click the downloaded installer to start the installation process.
4. Follow the prompts in the installer to complete the installation. You can choose the default settings for most options.

### 2. Open Visual Studio Code

1. After installation, open Visual Studio Code by double-clicking its shortcut on the desktop or searching for it in the Start Menu.

### 3. Install HashiCorp Terraform Extension

1. Once Visual Studio Code is open, click on the "Extensions" view icon in the sidebar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` to open the Extensions view.
2. In the Extensions view, search for "Terraform" in the search bar.
3. Look for the extension named "Terraform" provided by HashiCorp and click the "Install" button next to it.
4. Wait for the installation to complete.

### 4. Verify Extension Installation

1. After the installation is complete, you should see a green "Installed" label next to the "Terraform" extension in the Extensions view.
2. You can also verify the installation by checking if the Terraform extension commands are available in the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) when you type "terraform".

## Configure Terraform Extension (Optional)

1. By default, the Terraform extension should work out of the box without any additional configuration.
2. However, you can customize settings for the extension by going to File > Preferences > Settings and searching for "terraform".
3. Adjust the settings according to your preferences.

## Using Terraform Extension

1. Open a directory containing Terraform configuration files (`*.tf`) in Visual Studio Code.
2. The Terraform extension provides features such as syntax highlighting, IntelliSense for resource types and attributes, and code snippets to help you write Terraform configurations more efficiently.
3. You can also use the extension to initialize Terraform projects, apply changes, and manage Terraform state files directly from Visual Studio Code.

Visual Studio Code is now set up with the HashiCorp Terraform extension, allowing you to work with Terraform configurations seamlessly.
